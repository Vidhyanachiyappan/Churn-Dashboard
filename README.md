# Churn-Dashboard
I’m thrilled to share my latest project – Customer Churn Analysis in the Telecom industry! 

Churn Analysis Dashboard: Driving insights for smarter customer retention! - PwC Virtual Internship Program through Forage - Task 2!

Project Overview:
This Customer Churn Analysis dashboard examines factors influencing Telecom industry churn, using metrics like active/churn customers,  subscription time,  Tenure,  contract,  service usage and payment preferences.

With over 1,800 customers at risk and a churn rate of 26.54%, we're doubling down on improving support for fiber optic customers and promoting long-term contracts to reduce churn. 

Let's turn data into action! 

About the Dataset:
The dataset contains 7,043 entries and 23 columns which include customer demographics, service details,  churn information,  payment methods, and contract types.


𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗛𝗶𝗴𝗵𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀:
·        Total Customers :  7,043 | Churned customers: 1,869
·        Major Churn factors: Internet service type, tenure,contract and payment method.

·        Visual breakdown of contract types and tech support availability for deeper insights.
·        This dashboard aids in identifying high-risk customers and areas for improving retention.
·        Customers with month-to-month contracts show high churn rates compared to those with longer-terms contracts. 

Recommendations from my Analysis:
1.     It is recommended that the company should offer discounts or benefits for long-term contracts which could encourage month-to-month customers to switch to long-term plans, thereby reducing churn.
2.     Fiber optic customers show higher churn rates. Reducing the cost of fiber optic service might impact retention.
